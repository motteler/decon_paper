Dear Dr. Yueh,

Please find attached our paper "AIRS Deconvolution and the
Translation of AIRS to CrIS Radiances with Applications for the IR
Climate Record".  This describes some results we are using now for
analyzing AIRS and CrIS SNOs and which we hope to use as the basis
for a long-term combined AIRS and CrIS climate record.

best regards,

Howard Motteler
