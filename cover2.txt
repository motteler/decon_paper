Dear Dr. Yueh,

Please find attached a summary of the main changes weâ€™ve made,
detailed responses to each reviewer's questions, and a revised
version of our paper "AIRS Deconvolution and the Translation of AIRS
to CrIS Radiances with Applications for the IR Climate Record".
We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and have 
tried to incorporate or respond to all suggestions and questions.


best regards,


Howard Motteler
