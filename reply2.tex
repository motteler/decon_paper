\section{General Remarks}

We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments, and have tried
to incorporate all suggestions and respond to all questions.  The list
below includes reviewer's comments followed by our responses.

The discussion of reference truth for the deconvolution (starting on
page 3 line 30 RHS of the original submission) was not clear.  We
have updated the labels in figures 3 and 4 from ``gauss'' to ``decon
ref'' to better indicate we are showing the deconvolution reference
truth.  We updated the associated discussion to emphasize that the
deconvolution reference truth is simply a check of the deconvolution
step---we don't need it to do the deconvolution or for subsequent
reconvolution to CrIS or other targets.

We corrected the relationship of standard deviation and full-width
half-max (FWHM), $s=\fwhm / (2\sqrt{2\ln 2})$ in the original
submission, to $s=\fwhm / (2\sqrt{2}\,(\ln 2)^{1/(2p)})$.  The
latter is correct for the generalized Gaussian.  The difference is
small for the range of values $p$ we used.  As noted above this does
not effect the accuracy of the translations, just (to a very small
degree) the consistency of reference truth for the deconvolution and
the basis functions for our L1d ``idealized grating model''.

\section{Response to Comments}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1.~Page 2 right column, line 26, $||r_0||_2$ should be
    $||r_0||^2$, there are several other places need to be
    corrected.

    \reply:  $||r_0||^2$ would be the square of the Euclidian
    distance.  That would be harmless in our inequality $||r_0||_2
    \le ||r_j||_2$ but not what we want for condition number
    $||S_b||_2||S_b^{-1}||_2$ in the next sentence.  $||r||_2$ is a
    common notation for the $L^2$ norm, and for vectors is simply
    Euclidian distance.  The notation used in the paper is taken
    from the Wikipedia articles for the Moore-Penrose inverse and
    mathematical norm, and we've added both as citations.

%   Strang (our other reference for generalized inverse and a common
%   linear algebra text and reference) uses $||r||$ for Euclidian
%   distance and $||r||^2$ for distance squared.  Since we don't
%   want to imply the square of the norm, we have left this notation
%   as-is.

  \item 2.~Page 2, right column, lines 36-39 in the generalized
    Gaussian equation, please replace $c$ with other symbol.

    \reply: Agreed, we replaced this with $s$.

  \item In Fig 3 subplots 2 and 3: why do we see some overshoot
    and ringing in the deconvolution, especially at the shortwave
    CO$_2$ absorption lines?

    \reply: The ringing and overshoot at 2310~{\wn} appears to be
    caused by a change in the L1c channel spacing from 1.02~{\wn} to
    0.92~{\wn}.  These jumps occur at the AIRS focal plane module
    boundaries.  The first subplot of figure 2 shows channel spacing
    as a function of frequency, and the jump at 2310~{\wn} is one of
    several such discontinuities.  The deconvolution is sensitive to
    such changes in channel spacing; thus the ringing.  These
    artifacts are acceptable because we do not propose using the
    deconvolved radiances directly; they are an intermediate step
    before reconvolution to a lower resolution.  

%   Significant detail
%   is lost in the convolution of AIRS channel radiances and this
%   detail can only partially be recovered by a deconvolution.

  \item 4. The AIRS L1c channel spacing and resolving power R is
    around 1200 in Fig 2 (after deconvolution), why the direct
    convolution choose a resolving power of 2000 instead of 1200?
    The generalize Gaussian function could be adjusted to use a
    resolving power of 1200 to better match the deconvolved
    radiances.

    \reply: The direct convolution is reference truth for the
    deconvolution, and is now labeled ``decon ref'' in the plots.
    We choose 2000 because this is an approximate match to the
    resolving power of the deconvolution.  Resolving power of the
    deconvolution is a property of the deconvolution---we just want
    to measure it.  We compared the deconvolution with reference
    truth for a range of resolving powers from 1200 to 2400 and
    chose 2000 because the residuals do not decrease much beyond
    that point.

    We don't use the Gaussian basis for the AIRS deconvolution or
    the AIRS to CrIS translation---it is just a measure to see how
    well the deconvolution step alone works.  The deconvolution
    reference truth for a resolving power of 1200 is a very close
    match to the original AIRS radiances.

  \item 5. Page 4 right column, line 46, ``The constant or DC bias
    is...''  What is DC?

    \reply: DC is direct current.  We dropped this because we are
    doing statistics, not signal processing, and now just say ``the
    constant bias''.

  \item 6. Page 4 right column, lines 53-54, ``Up to this point
    there as been no statistical...'' please correct this sentence

    \reply: OK, fixed.

  \item 7. Page 5, regarding the NEdN. I am not clear how do you
    measure the AIRS-to-CrIS NEdN. If you know AIRS NEdN at 280 K,
    how do you translate that NEdN to CrIS observation? I donâ€™t
    understand the sentence: ``This is done repeatedly and the noise
    after translation is measured''.

    \reply: in outline, the steps are (1) generate ``true AIRS''
    spectra without noise, (2) for each spectra from step (1)
    generate a set of $n$ noise vectors at the AIRS NEdN spec and
    add them to the noise-free spectra, giving a set of $n$ noisy
    spectra, (3) translate this set from AIRS to CrIS, and (4)
    measure the standard deviation of the translation.  As a check
    we also measure the standard deviation before the translation,
    to verify that it agrees with our AIRS NEdN spec.
